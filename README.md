**Description**
How does Ethereum work? 
What is a smart contract anyways? 
Truffle is an Ethereum framework and not a glorified mushroom?

As a crypto enthusiast maybe you've asked yourself these questions before. And perhaps the most important question of all: what the heck can this be used for? We will tackle all these question in this masterclass. The best way to learn any skill is to get your hands dirty. So that's exactly what we will do. We will start from scratch, with a fresh OS install and we will end by deploying our application to a live Ethereum network. Along the way we will code in HTML, JavaScript and Solidity. We'll see how the Web3 framework connects our frontend to the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) and how MetaMask is our portal to the EVM. We will see how the Truffle framework makes our lives easier and we will gain a deep understanding of the interaction of all these components. 

So buckle up and lets build an Ethereum messenger!
